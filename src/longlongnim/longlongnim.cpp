 *
 * LongLongNim is a game played by two players who alternate turns. n coins
 * are arranged in a pack. A valid move consists of removing exactly X coins
 * from the pack, where X is an element of the set moves. If a player cannot
 * perform a valid move during his turn, he loses the game, and the other
 * player, of course, wins.
 *
 * You are given the set moves as a vector <int>, and you are also given an
 * int maxN. Return the number of different values of n between 1 and maxN,
 * inclusive, that make the game possible to win for the second player
 * (assuming both players play optimally).
